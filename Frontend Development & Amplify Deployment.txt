Amplify Deployment Process
Now that our backend is deployed, let’s host our CoffeeShop frontend using AWS Amplify.

Step 1: Fork the Repository
Visit: https://github.com/CrystallyRains/CoffeShop
Click Fork (top-right corner)
This creates a copy of the repo in your own GitHub account


Step 2: Deploy to AWS Amplify

Navigate to AWS Amplify Console
Start New App Deployment: Click "New app" → "Host web app"
Connect Git Provider: Select your Git provider (GitHub) > Click Next

Authorize AWS Amplify to access your repositories
Select Repository: Choose your coffee shop frontend repository
Select Branch: main



Step 3: Configure Build Settings
App name: CoffeShop (or your preferred name)
Build Configuration: Amplify will auto-detect your build settings.




Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
Add Environment Variables
Critical Step: Your React app needs to know your API Gateway URL.
In the App settings screen >Advanced Settings > Environment variables
Click Add environment variable
Add the following:
Key: VITE_API_URL
Value: https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com
Note: Don't include trailing slash in the URL


Step 5: Deploy Application
Review and Deploy: Review all configurations

Click "Save and deploy"

Monitor Deployment: Watch the build logs in real-time.


Step 6: Access Your Application
Get Your App URL
Once deployment completes, you'll receive a URL like:
<https://main.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com>
This URL is automatically HTTPS-enabled
Backed by CloudFront CDN for global performance



Step 7: Configure CORS for Production
Navigate to API Gateway Console
AWS Console → API Gateway → CoffeeShop API


Update CORS Configuration
Go to Develop → CORS
Click Configure
Add Amplify Domain: Update your CORS settings to include your new Amplify URL:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
**<https://main.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com> (Replace with your Amplify app URL)**

Access-Control-Allow-Headers:
**Content-Type, Authorization**

Access-Control-Allow-Methods:
**GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**


Why Deploy? CORS changes don't take effect until the API is redeployed.
Step 8: Functional Testing
Access Your Deployed App: Open your Amplify URL in browser

Verify the app loads without errors
Test All CRUD Operations:
READ Operations:
View all coffee items (GET /coffee)

View individual coffee details (GET /coffee/{id})

CREATE Operations:
Add new coffee item (POST /coffee)

Verify item appears in list immediately

UPDATE Operations:
Edit existing coffee item (PUT /coffee/{id})

Confirm changes are saved

DELETE Operations:
Remove coffee item (DELETE /coffee/{id})


Verify item disappears from list
